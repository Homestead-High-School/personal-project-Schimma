With this function you can check the rom header info,Drag your gba rom and dorp it on the application.

2.Intro Remover
With this function you can remove the general intro,just like gbaintroremover you used to use.
Note:don't try to edit the start offset if you are not sure where it is,For the unusual intro rom,even if you know the start offset,the game still doesn't work after removing the intro,because the game start address has been modified by release group.

3.Overdump Fixer
With this function you can fix the rom overdumped.
Note:make sure that the rom is REALLY overdumped.

With this function you can fix the header if this header is corrupt.
The rom with corrupt header can't be run on the GBA hardware or on emu with BIOS.

With this function you can draw the intro and make it the independent intro file.
1.single draw
Only save the intro with header,the intro file is very small,but not always works.
2.original draw
Save the original rom with all game data gone,the intro file is large(original size),but the size will cut down after being ziped.

With this function you can patch an ips to the rom.
