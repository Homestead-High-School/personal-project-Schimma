<I>Virtual GameBoy Advance (VGBA)</I> emulates Nintendo's GameBoy
Advance handheld videogame console. VGBA can run most commercial GameBoy
Advance software on a desktop, palmtop, or any sufficiently fast computing
device. It will also run <U>correctly written</U> homebrewn software. You
can always get the latest version of VGBA at

VGBA is a logical continuation of my previous work in videogame
emulation, namely, the
<I><A HREF="http://fms.komkon.org/VGB/">Virtual GameBoy (VGB)</A></I>.
VGB emulates GameBoy Classic, GameBoy Pocket, Super GameBoy, and
GameBoy Color. VGBA is a completely different program though. It will
not run the original GameBoy software, so you will have to use VGB for
that.

<CENTER><H1>VGBA Ports</H1></CENTER>
</A>
<P>
Because VGBA is a very portable program, it can be compiled on many
different platforms: Windows, Unix, Linux, Android, MacOS, MSDOS, etc.
The complete up-to-date list of VGBA ports can be found at the VGBA
homepage. Following are just the major VGBA ports: 
</P>

</CENTER>
<P>
Once you download a copy, you should be able to use it on as many Android
devices as you own, as long as they are all linked to the same Google Play
account. Make sure to enable automatic updates, as VGBA-Android updates
often. The Android version comes with many additional features, such as
<I>Cheatopedia</I> with cheat codes for many popular games, <I>State
Exchange</I> letting VGBA users exchange saved games, the <I>Box Art
Downloader</I>, improved <I>Network Play</I> functionality, and more.

I am always trying to compile it on as many different Unix and Linux
flavors as I have handy at the moment.
</P>

<DT><H2>VGBA-Maemo and VGBA-Meego</H2>
<DD>
<P>
The VGBA-Maemo works on Nokia devices running Maemo or Meego OS. It is
specifically optimized for Maemo platform and available for free from
respective package repositories and VGBA homepage. As both Maemo and
Meego platforms are dead, I am no longer developing for them though.
</P>

<DT><H2>VGBA-MSDOS</H2>
<DD>
<P>
I am no longer developing and supporting VGBA-MSDOS, as the MSDOS platform
is completely dead nowadays. Older VGBA-MSDOS versions were sold as part
of the <A HREF="#VGBA-Windows">VGBA-Windows package</A> (now free) and
used <I>DOS4GW</I> extender and <I>VESA</I> screen drivers on MSDOS
and Windows platforms.
</P>

<DT><H2>VGBA-Symbian</H2>
<DD>
<P>
The VGBA-Symbian port ran on phones running the 3rd Edition of the Nokia
S60 software. It is no longer being developed and supported, as Symbian
and all its development tools are dead. You can still access some of my
Symbian products at this address though:

<DD>
<P>
The PocketPC version of VGBA has long been developed by Aaron Oneal. As
PocketPC is long dead though, VGBA-PocketPC is dead as well. You can still
get older PocketPC versions of VGBA and my other emulators from

</A>
<P>
This version of VGBA has emulation for the following:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>ARM7TDMI CPU with ARM and THUMB opcode sets.
<LI>Internal RAM at addresses <CODE>0x03000000</CODE> (32kB) and
    <CODE>0x02000000</CODE> (256kB).
<LI>Cartridge ROM at address <CODE>0x08000000</CODE>, mirrored at
    <CODE>0x0A000000</CODE> and <CODE>0x0C000000</CODE>.
<LI>Cartridge RAM at address <CODE>0x0E000000</CODE> (64kB).
<LI>Cartridge FlashROM (JEDEC) at address <CODE>0x0E000000</CODE> (64kB).
<LI>Cartridge serial EEPROM at address <CODE>0x09000000</CODE> (64x64bits),
    mirrored at <CODE>0x0B000000</CODE> and <CODE>0x0D000000</CODE>.
<LI>Interrupts: VBlank, HBlank, line coincidence, timers, DMA, joypad.
<LI>Timers: TIMER0, TIMER1, TIMER2, TIMER3.
<LI>DMA channels: DMA0, DMA1, DMA2, DMA3.
<LI>DMA modes (instantaneous, HBlank, VBlank, HRefresh) and repeat feature.
<LI>Joypad buttons and interrupts.
<LI>GameBoy-compatible melodic sound chip with GBA extensions.
<LI>Two channels of GBA-specific "direct" sound.
</UL>
<P>
Not emulated:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>DMA timings are not correct. DMA happens "instantly".
<LI>CPU timings are close but not entirely correct. VGBA considers all
    memory accesses as "sequential". There are some other discrepancies
    as well, but overally, it should be pretty close.
</UL>

Here is a list of emulated features:

Including the real Nintendo BIOS with the emulator would be a copyright
violation. Therefore, I have tried to simulate GBA BIOS routines
by trapping and handling ARM <CODE>SWI</CODE> opcodes. GBA BIOS is now
fully emulated except for the built-in music player and some networking
routines. Here is the list of supported BIOS calls:

<P>
Absolutely no ROM images of commercial GameBoy Advance games are included.
These games are copyrighted by the companies which produced them, and
therefore, I cannot distribute any of these games. I'm also unable to tell
you where to find the games, so do not send me email asking for them. You
will have to look for them on your own.
</P>
<P>
It may also be a good idea to buy a real cartridge for each GameBoy
Advance ROM image you use with the emulator. Owning a real, physical
cartridge is the right thing to do, both legally and ethically.
</P>
<P>
The VGBA web page contains some links to GameBoy Advance cartridge copier
info. Cartridge copiers can be used to dump GameBoy Advance cartridges
into files. I cannot provide you with any additional information about
these copiers, so do not send me email asking for this information. Use
the copier-related links at the VGBA web page. 
</P>
<P>
GameBoy Advance has a BIOS ROM inside with some useful subroutines.
Including the real Nintendo BIOS with the emulator would be clearly illegal.
Instead, VGBA tries to simulate GBA BIOS routines. It still has an option
to use the real BIOS supplied from the <CODE>GBA.ROM</CODE> file in the
current directory. I cannot tell you where to find the real BIOS, so do
not ask me about it. The current BIOS simulation is quite functional. It
also runs faster than the real BIOS would on the emulator.

<OL>
<LI><B>I WANNA PLAY GAMES!!!! WHERE DO I GET GAMES???????</B>
<P>
I do not know. I can't give you any due to both legal and moral reasons.
Please, do not mail me asking for games. I will delete your mail right
away, and you won't get an answer.
</P>
<LI><B>Can I play GameBoy Classic and GameBoy Color games on VGBA?</B>
<P>
No, you can't. GameBoy Advance hardware is completely different from the
older GameBoy and GameBoy Color models. To play older games, you may
want to consider my other emulator,
<I><A HREF="http://fms.komkon.org/VGB/">Virtual GameBoy</A> (VGB)</I>.
</P>
<LI><B>How do I copy games from cartridges to a computer?</B>
<P>
You can use a special device called cartridge copier, such as 
<I>Flash Advance Linker</I> from
<A HREF="http://www.lik-sang.com/"><I>Lik-Sang</I></A>. Don't forget to 
get a rewritable flash card too.
</P>
<LI><B>What is GameBoy Advance? How its hardware works?</B>
<P>
GameBoy Advance (GBA) is a handheld videogame machine made by Nintendo. Its
hardware has nothing to do with GameBoy and GameBoy Color handhelds
previously produced by Nintendo. GBA is built around an ARM7TDMI 32bit
CPU running at 16MHz. GBA video subsystem is very similar to that of SNES,
but more advanced. The sound subsystem uses direct sample output. GBA also
includes the four-channel melodic sound chip from the original GameBoy.
</P>
<P>
In order to be compatible with the original GB/GBC, GBA includes the complete
set of GBC hardware. This hardware (aside from the sound chip) is not
accessible from the GBA side and only used when somebody inserts a GB/GBC
cartridge into GBA.
</P>
<LI><B>There is no version of VGBA for my Unix!</B>
<P>
I am trying to compile Unix binaries for as many flavors of Unix as
possible, but as I do not have access to many machines, do not expect
immediate support for every Unix flavor out there. Don't mail me asking
for the source either: VGBA source code is not publicly distrbutable,
as much as I regret to say this :(.
</P>
<LI><B>My favorite game doesn't work on VGBA. What do I do?</B>
<P>
There may be several reasons why a game has problems running on VGBA
or does not run at all.
</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>
    If emulator does not even recognize the ROM image, its CRC or CMP
    may be wrong. Try turning CRC checking off by using the
    <CODE>-nocrc</CODE> option or clearing "Check Cartridge CMP" checkbox
    in VGBA-Windows Setup Panel. You really ought to find an uncorrupted
    ROM image though.
</P>
<LI>
<P>
    The game may be using a different EEPROM type. EEPROM is a little
    chip that sits on a cartridge and stores save-games. Some GBA games
    use 64x64bit EEPROMs (<CODE>-eeprom 6</CODE>) while others use
    16384x64bit EEPROMs (<CODE>-eeprom 14</CODE>). In VGBA-Windows, you
    can simply select the EEPROM type from the Setup Panel.
</P>
<LI>
<P>
    If some sprites blink or do not appear at all, try changing
    <CODE>-skip</CODE> value (0 will give you the best picture, but
    the slowest emulation), or moving an "Skip Frames" knob in the
    VGBA-Windows Setup Panel.
</P>
<LI>
<P>
    VGBA may not currently run this game. Not all games are supported at  
    this moment. Don't expect 100% compatibility with the real hardware. 
    At least, not yet :).
</P>
</UL>
</P>
<LI><B>Direct sound sounds really bad!</B>
<P> 
Use <CODE>-ds</CODE> command line option (or corresponding options in the
VGBA-Windows Setup Panel) to choose the way VGBA renders direct sound. In
Windows, you should also try changing volume, sound rate, and the number
of sound buffers. If this doesn't help, you may be out of luck. Hopefully,
sound emulation becomes better in the upcoming versions.
</P>
<LI><B>Why is VGBA so slow on my machine?</B>
<P> 
Because your machine is too slow to run VGBA. My experience shows that
you need at least a PentiumII/400 machine with fast video to run VGBA
at a reasonable speed. Following are the ways to speed things up:
</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Increase Update Period. The picture will get more jerky, but VGBA
    will become faster.
<LI>On Unix, always use MIT Shared Memory Extension for X (MITSHM). This,
    of course, means that you have to run VGB locally.
<LI>On Windows and Unix, use 1:1 window to achieve the highest speed.
<LI>On Windows, use MIDI sound, as wave synthesis takes quite a lot of
    CPU time.
</UL>
</P> 
<LI><B>VGBA is too fast on my machine! How do I slow it down?</B>
<P>
Frankly, when I started writing VGBA, I never expected that it will be
<U>too fast</U> on any machine :). But times change...
</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>On Unix, use <CODE>-sync</CODE> option to tie screen updates to
    the certain frequency.
<LI>On Windows, use "Sync To..." option in the Setup Panel to tie
    screen updates to a certain frequency.
<LI>Decrease "Skip Frames" (<CODE>-skip</CODE> on Unix) value. The
    emulation will become much slower, but smoother.
<LI>On Windows and Unix, double or triple the window size.
</UL>
</P>
<LI><B>When starting VGBA-Unix, ld says that some library isn't found.</B>
<P>
This may happen if the versions of your shared libraries are older than
the ones for which VGBA has been compiled. A decent way to deal with this
is to upgrade your Unix. A quick and dirty way is to make a symbolic link 
from the existing library to a name required by VGBA.
</P>
<LI><B>When starting VGBA-Unix, I get X_ShmAttach error.</B>
<P>
You are probably trying to run VGBA-Unix on a remote Xterminal while it
attempts to use shared memory for interfacing with X. Use
<CODE>-noshm</CODE> option to tell it not to use shared memory. 
</P>
<LI><B>When starting VGBA-Unix, I get X_PutImage error.</B>
<P>
VGBA-Unix version currently needs 16bit X. Xterminals that do not support
16bit image format will not work.
</P>
<LI><B>The sound is distorted in the VGBA-Windows. How do I fix it?</B>
<P>
The wave-synthetized sound in VGBA may become distorted on slow or
highly loaded machines (no graphics acceleration, for example). There are
several ways you can improve sound:
</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Use MIDI sound instead. It has both advantages and disadvantages
    though.
<LI>Make VGBA window smaller to decrease the load on the CPU. 1:1 is
    the optimal size.
<LI>Decrease the sound rate (in Setup Panel). The sound may become tinkier,
    but less distorted.
<LI>Increase the number of wave buffers (in Setup Panel). This may
    cause sound to fall a second or two behind the screen action, but
    the sound quality will become better.
</UL>
</P>
<LI><B>Does VGBA-Windows support joystick? My joystick doesn't work!</B>
<P>
VGBA-Windows supports joystick. If your joystick does not work, go into
Windows Control Panel to see if it is configured and calibrated properly. 
Also, some new joysticks working in esoteric standards (like GRiP) are
known to have problems.
</P>
<LI><B>Colors are all screwed up in VGBA-Windows!</B>
<P>
VGBA-Windows <U>requires</U> Windows to be in 65536-color or better
color mode. When running Windows in 256-color mode, it will try to
approximate colors to existing ones, but expect results to be dismal.
</P>
<LI><B>Black window in VGBA-Windows!</B>
<P>
If you are running Windows in 256-color mode, then this is most likely
the cause of a problem. Try switching Windows into 65536-color or better
screen mode. 
</P>
<LI><B>How do I save and load the GBA state during the game?</B>
<P>
The GBA state can be saved by pressing [F7] button. The resulting
data file will have the same name as your .GBA file, but its extension is
going to be .STA. You can load state from this file by pressing [F8]
at any point in the game. This state file will also be loaded automatically
next time you start VGBA. The same state file is not guaranteed to work for
versions of VGBA running on a different hardware. State saving is not
perfect yet, so for some games state may not be correctly saved.
